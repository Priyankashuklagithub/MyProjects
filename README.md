# MyProjects
This repository gives a glimpse of collection of projects I have worked upon so far. These projects demonstrate my skills and experience in various domains of Remote Sensing and GIS. Each project includes detailed documentation, source code, and relevant resources to provide a comprehensive overview of my work.
(i) Google earth engine based temporal analysis of indices used for forest fire study in Mizoram, India.
(ii) Forset Fire Burn Scar Mapping.
(iii) Mapping Forest Fire Susceptibility.
(iv) Combined Optical and SAR remote sensing for LULC mapping of Imphal valley using Machine Learning Algorithm.
(v) Climate Change Impact Analysis: Precipitation, Tempertaure Trends.
